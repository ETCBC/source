# ETCBC Source Data

This repository contains the source data files produced by the [data creation pipeline](http://www.etcbc.nl/datacreation) at the Eep Talstra Centre for Bible and Computer.

These source files are used for the creation of [Text-Fabric BHSA data](https://github.com/ETCBC/bhsa) and [MQL data](https://github.com/ETCBC/shebanq/wiki).
